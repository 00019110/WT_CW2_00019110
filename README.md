# Book Review Web Application ðŸ“š

This web application was developed as part of the **Web Technologies** module at **WIUT**. It enables users to manage book reviews with full **CRUD** functionalityâ€”Create, Read, Update, and Deleteâ€”covering the book's title, author, genre, and the actual review content.

### Key Features

- All users can **view** reviews.
- Only **registered and logged-in users** can **add**, **edit**, or **delete** their own reviews.
- Built-in validation ensures review text length is between **10 and 500 characters**.
- RESTful routing and proper **error handling** implemented.
- Clean and responsive UI styled with **basic CSS**.

### Technologies Used

- Backend: Node.js, Express.js  
- Frontend: Pug templating engine, CSS  
- Database: MongoDB Atlas (connected via Mongoose)    
- Validation: express-validator
